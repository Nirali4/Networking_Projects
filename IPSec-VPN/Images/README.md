A Crypto map is used for identifying the crypto peer and where the traffic should flow.

Port-Channel will help to support the high availability and speed. It will allow two physical links to work as a single logical link. Hence, if link-1 will have any technical issue than the network will not go down as the Link-2 will be up and running.

IP address works like a street address, so that router will know exactly where the data should be transmitted. This sample shows how two links (primary and back-up) been created with a simple and clear description. This WAN topology is also known as "Double homed-single ISP".
