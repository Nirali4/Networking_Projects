# Port Address Translation
PAT stands for Port Address Translation which is a feature on network devices which allows multiple users to use same Public IP address from that private network. It is an extended form of Network Address Translation.

As the aount of network devices are constalntly, the demand for the IP addresses are increased too. Hence, the solution for not running out of IP addresses been found, which includes PAT, NAT, and IPv6. Use of PAT in network reduces the operational cost, as the least or no extra IP addresses will require to lease from Internet Service Provides.

<h3>Project scenario:</h3>
Simple network scenario is created to demonstrate how PAT can be implemented on network. This project also concentrated on feature like Dynamic Host Configuration (DHCP) and Access control Lists (ACLs). The DHCP will allow us to automatically provide the IP addresses to the network devices and ACL will make sure that only authorised network/users are accessing the company's network. Simpley, ACLs are type of filteration occuring whenever any packet leaves/enter the private network. 

<h3>Requirements to run the project:</h3>
Before you downloading the <a href="https://github.com/Nirali4/Networking_Projects/blob/master/Network-Port-Address-Translation/Network-Port-Address-Translation.pkt">"Network-Port-Address-Translation.pkt"</a>file, you will require to have Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 7.3 or higher) to run the Project.
